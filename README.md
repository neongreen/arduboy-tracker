## Manual

The red buttons are `A` and `B`. The `A` button is used as a Shift-like modifier for extra actions.

Counters:

* Up/down = move up/down, left/right = decrement/increment.

* `A` + `L` = reset counter.

Timer:

* `B` = set a one-minute timer (not related to the selected counter) or add a minute to the running timer.

* `A` + `B` = reset the timer.

* Hold `A` = show seconds.
